# Rocket-Elevators-Python-Controller
The purpose of this code is to make a simple, yet effective controller for an elevator. enjoy (:


Imagine it, youre in a fancy building and you want to go to the top. Thrilling. You, the user, go up to the frame and press one of two buttons, "up" or "down are your choices.
Whatever your choice was, the column will control the elevator to go to your location, and to add it to a queue. The doors open, you step inside and you are greeted by buttons.
These buttons are for you to choose the floor youd like to go to. You choose one, and the doors close. The column then controlls the elevator to go in the direction you requested.
You start going in that direction and soon, the elevator is set to "stopped". The doors open for you, and then they close behind you as you step out. You just rode the best elevator in existence.
youre welcome.
